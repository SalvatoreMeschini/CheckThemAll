# CheckThemAll

Firefox add-on based on the WebExtensions API
This add-on allows to check / uncheck / invert checkboxes contained in the current selection.

**NOTES**: 
* CheckThemAll does not work with checkboxes in external iframes
* CheckThemAll requires you to create a selection around the checkboxes that you want to check/uncheck/invert before choosing what to do with them
* CheckThemAll can't work with items that look like checkboxes but actually are a different thing (i.e. Gmail)

## Installation

This add-on requires Firefox 57+ and it can be installed from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/checkthemall/
